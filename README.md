# plugNmeet-recorder

The plugNmeet-recorder handles session recording and RTMP streaming for plugNmeet. It is designed for scalability and can record multiple sessions simultaneously. You can deploy multiple recorder instances to create a horizontally scalable, highly available recording infrastructure. The plugnmeet-server will automatically balance the load across the available recorders.

## Requirements

*   A Linux system (Ubuntu is recommended)
*   Google Chrome
*   PulseAudio
*   Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer)
*   FFmpeg

## Installation

These instructions are for Ubuntu.

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install PulseAudio, Xvfb, and FFmpeg
sudo apt install -y pulseaudio xvfb ffmpeg

# Start PulseAudio and enable it to start on boot
pulseaudio -D --verbose --exit-idle-time=-1 --disallow-exit
systemctl --user enable pulseaudio

# Install Google Chrome
curl -fsSL https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/googlechrome-linux-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/googlechrome-linux-keyring.gpg] http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list > /dev/null
sudo apt -y update && sudo apt -y install google-chrome-stable

# Optional: Install additional fonts
sudo apt install -y fonts-noto fonts-liberation
```

### 2. Install the Recorder

1.  Download the latest release for your architecture from the [releases page](https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-recorder/releases) or use the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mynaparrot/plugnmeet-recorder).
2.  Extract the downloaded archive and navigate into the new directory.
3.  Create a configuration file from the sample:

    ```bash
    cp config_sample.yaml config.yaml
    ```

## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to configure the recorder.

### Basic Configuration

*   **`nats_info`**: This section must match the NATS configuration in your `plugnmeet-server`'s `config.yaml`.
*   **`main_path`**: This should be the same as `recording_files_path` in your `plugnmeet-server`'s `config.yaml`.
*   **`plugNmeet_info`**: Update this section with your plugNmeet server details.

**Important:** If you use NFS or other network-mounted storage for recordings, ensure both the recorder and the `plugnmeet-server` can access the storage path. Otherwise, users won't be able to download recordings.

### Multi-server Deployment

You can run multiple `plugnmeet-recorder` instances for load balancing and high availability. The `plugnmeet-server` will automatically choose a recorder based on server load.

When deploying multiple recorders:

*   Assign a unique `id` in each `config.yaml` (e.g., `node_01`, `node_02`).
*   Adjust the `max_limit` value in `config.yaml` based on each serverâ€™s capacity.

## Running the Recorder

To start the recorder, run the binary for your system's architecture:

```bash
# For AMD64
./plugnmeet-recorder-linux-amd64

# For ARM64
./plugnmeet-recorder-linux-arm64
```

## Deployment Recommendations

For optimal performance, especially when recording frequently, we recommend deploying the `plugnmeet-recorder` on a dedicated server, separate from your plugNmeet or LiveKit instance. This is because recording can be a CPU-intensive process.

However, if you only plan to record sessions infrequently, running the recorder on the same server is a viable option. For a streamlined and automated installation on a single server, you can use the [plugnmeet-install](https://github.com/mynaparrot/plugNmeet-install) script.

## Development

1.  Clone this repository and navigate into the project directory.
2.  Create configuration files from the samples:

    ```bash
    cp config_sample.yaml config.yaml
    cp docker-compose_sample.yaml docker-compose.yaml
    ```
3.  Update `config.yaml` with your development settings.
4.  Build and start the development environment using Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    docker compose build
    docker compose up
    ```
